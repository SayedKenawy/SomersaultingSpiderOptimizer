The **Somersaulting Spider Optimizer (SSO)** is a novel metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the dynamic movement strategies of somersaulting spiders.  
By simulating their ability to alternate between high-mobility somersaults and agile rolling behaviors, SSO provides a powerful framework for efficiently solving challenging optimization problems across academic and industrial domains.

## üìñ Description  

SSO belongs to the family of nature-inspired optimization algorithms, drawing inspiration from the behavioral ecology of somersaulting spiders.  
Unlike classical optimization methods, SSO alternates between two biologically inspired strategies‚Äî**somersaulting** (for global exploration) and **rolling** (for local exploitation)‚Äîallowing the algorithm to balance diversification and intensification effectively.  
This adaptive mechanism ensures strong performance on complex, high-dimensional optimization problems.  

SSO is particularly well-suited for global optimization tasks in:  

- Engineering  
- Machine Learning  
- Data Science  
- Artificial Intelligence  
- Operations Research

## ‚ú® Features  

- **Somersaulting Movement** ‚Üí Enables global exploration and avoids local optima.  
- **Rolling Movement** ‚Üí Focuses on local exploitation and solution refinement.  
- **Adaptive Energy Mechanism** ‚Üí Dynamic adaptation to prevent stagnation.  
- **Broad Applicability** ‚Üí Handles both continuous and discrete optimization.  
- **Modular Design** ‚Üí Easy integration with custom objective functions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works  

1. **Initialization** ‚Üí Randomly generate candidate solutions.  
2. **Evaluation** ‚Üí Compute fitness using the objective function.  
3. **Somersaulting & Rolling** ‚Üí Alternate between global and local search.  
4. **Adaptation** ‚Üí Update energy levels and stagnation counters.  
5. **Convergence** ‚Üí Stop when iteration limit or stopping criterion is met.

## üöÄ Usage  

```python
from SSO import SSO

def objective_function(x):
    # Example: Sphere function
    return sum(x**2)

lb = -10
ub = 10
dim = 30
SearchAgents_no = 30
Max_iter = 500

result = SSO(objective_function, lb, ub, dim, SearchAgents_no, Max_iter)
print("Best solution found:", result.bestIndividual)
print("Best fitness value:", result.best)
```
